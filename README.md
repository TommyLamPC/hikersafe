# hikersafe
This hiking application uses Flutter as a development software tool, so it can support cross-platform IOS and Android use. This application also uses firebase as a back end and stores data in the cloud, so there is no need to build a local server to operate this application. Allow users to design and follow the route to share information about hiking. I believe this program can greatly facilitate hiking and reduce the risk of hikers.
